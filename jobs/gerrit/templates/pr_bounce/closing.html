Dear Cloud Foundry contributor,

<p>
If you are reading this message, it means you submitted a pull request in the
Cloud Foundry GitHub repository.
</p>

<p>
First of all, thanks! We really appreciate your participation.
</p>

<p>
Recently we made some changes in how we are verifying and reviewing open source
contributions like yours. In addition, we changed the way we can expose our
internal development in real-time. The changes are exciting, as they allow all
our staff to collaborate seamlessly with you, which increases our mutual
velocity and gives the community a bigger stake in our direction.
</p>

<p>
The Cloud Foundry team uses Gerrit, a code review tool that originated in the
Android Open Source Project. We also use GitHub as an official mirror, though
all pull requests are accepted via Gerrit.
</p>
